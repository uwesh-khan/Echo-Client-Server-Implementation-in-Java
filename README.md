 # Echo Client-Server Implementation in Java 

This project demonstrates a simple Echo Client-Server application using Java. The server listens for incoming connections and echoes back any received messages to the client. 
The client connects to the server, sends a message, and waits for the echoed response.

# Features
* Single-threaded TCP Echo Server
* Simple TCP Echo Client
* Connection over localhost on port 8080

# Getting Started
These instructions will guide you on setting up the project locally. To run the server and client, you need to have Java installed on your system.

# Prerequisites:
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) latest version (prefer) installed on your system. You can download it from the official Oracle website or use OpenJDK.
